Path is composed of two parts: relative path and absolute path
More on path:
```
~(tide)      # This is a shortcut for your home directory, 
               that is, /home/znz/a equal to ~\a

.(dot)       # This is a reference to the current directory
..(ddot)     # This is a reference to the parent directory
```

Change the path
```
cd [location] 
```

Shortcut of typing the path
```
Typing out these paths can be tedious, 
we can use the Tab Completion to help us.
